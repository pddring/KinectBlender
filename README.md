This probably isn't going to work... but it'll be fun to try.

I have an old (discontinued and unsupported) XBox One Kinect sensor.

I run a 3d game development club at school where students are learning to create characters using Blender.

I'd like to have one computer in my room connected to a Kinect sensor that performs motion capture. All other computers in the same room should be able to connect over the LAN to live stream motion capture data to control the pose of their 3d character in Blender.

## Setup:
* Install the Kinect runtime: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44559
* Install the Kinect SDK: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561
